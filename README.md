# Portfolio_Python_Terminal_Game_BattleShip

This is my first program, it is meant to be a battleship game. 
Start the game, enter a number, and get feedback if it is a hit or miss. 
Also, there is a fail-safe for typing high or low numbers, letters, or symbols. 
A ship is generated randomly. 
Typing exit or q will exit the game. 
At the end, there is an option to restart the game.
