# Portfolio_Python_Terminal_Game_BattleShip

This is my first program, it is meant to be a battleship game.
Start the game, enter number and get feed back if it is a hit or miss.
Also their is a fail safe for typeing to high or low number,letters or symbols.
Ship is generated randomly. 
Typing exit will exit the game.
